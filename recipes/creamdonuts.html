        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>These Boston cream Hawaiian roll "donuts" are a surprisingly accurate shortcut version of vanilla cream-filled donuts with chocolate topping. You have to try them.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 (12 count) package Hawaiian rolls, separated into 12 rolls</li>
                <li>4 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
                <li>1 (3,5 ounce) package vanilla instant pudding mix, such as  Jell-O®</li>
                <li>1 1/2 cups whipped topping</li>
                <li>1 3/4 cups milk, divided</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                <li>1 pinch salt</li>
                <li>3/4 cup semisweet chocolate chips</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).  Brush rolls with melted butter on all sides and place on a baking sheet. </li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned and toasted, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
                <li>Whisk pudding mix, 1 1/2 cups milk, vanilla, and salt together in a bowl until well combined and thickened. Fold in whipped topping. Refrigerate for 10 minutes to set up; transfer filling to a piping bag or a plastic bag. Make a small cut in the corner if using a plastic bag.</li>
                <li>Use a paring knife to make a small cut into one side of each roll, creating an opening large enough to pipe filling into without going all the way through. Fill each hole with about 1 to 1 1/2 tablespoons filling. </li>
                <li>Heat remaining 1/4 cup milk until scalding in the microwave, 30 to 40 seconds. Place chocolate chips in a shallow bowl, and pour in hot milk. Let stand 10 seconds; stir until smooth. Heat in the microwave 15 seconds if necessary to finish melting the chocolate.</li>
                <li>Line a tray with parchment. Dip the top of each filled roll in chocolate; place on the tray to cool completely and for chocolate to harden slightly, about 20 minutes, or refrigerate for 5 to 10 minutes before serving.</li>
            </ol>
